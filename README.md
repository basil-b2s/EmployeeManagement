# EmployeeMgmnt
 
Build Restful API's for an Employee Management Application, with the following features:
- A manager should be able to add employees.
- An employee should be able to apply for leaves.
- A manager should be able to approve leaves.
- An employee should be able to view his details alone, including approved/pending leaves.
- A manager should be able to see all his reportees

**Login/Logout API's should be build.
**Use Cookie based Auth.
**Need not use any Databases for this, try to keep singleton class instead.
